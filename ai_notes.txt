**Clear Study Notes:**

### Introduction to Processor-Oriented Programming

Processor-Oriented Programming (POP) is a type of programming paradigm that focuses on the processor or functions rather than data. The most common examples of POP languages are C, Fortran, and Cobol.

### Drawbacks of Processor-Oriented Programming

There are six major drawbacks of POP:

1. **Difficulty in Maintenance**: POP codes are difficult to maintain, especially when the code grows larger than the maximum limit of the program.
2. **Lack of Data Security**: In POP, data is exposed to the entire program, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access and modification.
3. **Difficulty in Relating to Real-World Objects**: POP makes it challenging to relate to real-world objects, as it focuses on functions rather than data.
4. **Difficulty in Creating New Data Types**: Creating new data types in POP is complex and difficult, unlike in object-oriented programming languages.
5. **Importance Given to Operations Rather Than Data**: POP prioritizes operations on data over the data itself, which can lead to inefficient programming.
6. **Lack of Automatic Memory Management**: POP languages do not have automatic memory management, which can lead to memory leaks and other issues.

### Object-Oriented Programming as a Solution

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) languages, such as Java, C++, and C#, can overcome the drawbacks of POP. OOP focuses on data and provides features like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it easier to relate to real-world objects and create new data types. Additionally, OOP languages like Java have automatic memory management, which eliminates the need for manual memory allocation and deallocation.
